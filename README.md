# One Button Game
This game was built for Local Hack Day: Share 2021's livestream. This repository is the template code needed to participate with the [livestream](https://twitch.tv/mlh). If you like this content, follow [Mara on Twitch](https://twitch.com/maradrinksmilk) or find [Mara on Twitter](https://twitter.com/maradrinksmilk).

This was built using [Ania Kubow's tutorial](https://youtu.be/dhpjjAxKbHE) + [Original GitHub](https://github.com/kubowania/flappy-birds-react-native) as a template and then edited to fit a workshop style.

## Set Up the Environment
It's assumed you have your own IDE ready!
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for npm
2. In your terminal, run `npm install -g expo-cli`. This will make it easier to get your mobile app set up!
3. `git clone --branch template https://github.com/maralihart/one-button-game.git`
8. `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies
5. `npm start` to open a console in `localhost:19002`
6. On the left hand side, click `Run in web browser` to get the app visible!
